# IRIS-Flower-Classification
This project classifies iris flowers into three species (**Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica**) using machine learning. It uses **sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width** as input features.

## Dataset
The dataset used is the famous **Iris Dataset**, available from the https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arshid/iris-flower-dataset

## ðŸ“Œ Project Workflow
1. **Data Exploration** â€“ Perform EDA to understand feature distribution.
2. **Data Preprocessing** â€“ Handle missing data, scale features, and prepare the dataset.
3. **Model Training** â€“ Train classifiers like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, and Neural Networks.
4. **Evaluation & Prediction** â€“ Evaluate models using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification reports.

## ðŸ’» Installation
To set up the project locally:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Iris-Flower-Classification.git
   cd Iris-Flower-Classification
pip install -r requirements.txt

 Dependencies
Required Python libraries:

pandas

numpy

matplotlib

seaborn

scikit-learn

jupyter
Usage
Run notebooks/data_exploration.ipynb for EDA.

Run notebooks/model_training.ipynb to preprocess and train models.

Results

The best-performing model achieves an accuracy of XX%.

Feature importance analysis shows that petal length and petal width are the most significant features.
